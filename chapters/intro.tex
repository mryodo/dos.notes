\paragraph*{ Main Contributions. } Our main contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
      \item we show that sparsification measure (which is necessary to sample sparse spectral approximation of an up-Laplacian operator of simplicial complex) is directly related to local densities of states of a higher-order down-Laplacian;
      \item we develop a novel method of kernel ignoring decomposition (KID) for efficient approximation of LDoS;
      \item finally, we exploit existing error estimates to derive KID parameters sufficient for an arbitrary approximation quality and demonstrate the corresponding competitive algorithmic complexity for the method.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{ Outline. } The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we provide the brief introduction of simplicial complexes and its densities of states as a fast computable proxies of spectral information, CREF. CREF states the sparsification result and demonstrates its connection to the local spectral densities with CREF describing a novel approach which efficiently computes the sparsifying probability measure. We provide numerical experiments in CREF, CREF concludes.
